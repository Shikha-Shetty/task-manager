# task-manager
Built a RESTful API for a simple task manager application performing CRUD operations

In this project, I have created a RESTful API using Node.js, Express.js, and NPM packages. The API will allow users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on tasks. The tasks has a title, description, and a flag for completion status. 

## Introduction

I have implemented RESTful API with the following endpoints:

GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.

GET /tasks/:id: Retrieve a single task by its ID.

POST /tasks: Create a new task.

PUT /tasks/:id: Update an existing task by its ID.

DELETE /tasks/:id: Delete a task by its ID.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you'll need [list of requirements, e.g., Node.js, Python 3.x, etc.]. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your/repository.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-directory`
3. Install dependencies: 
npm install

## Usage

To start the API server, run the following command:
npm run start
